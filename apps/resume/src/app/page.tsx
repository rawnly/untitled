              At the age of 7, my passion for technology was sparked by my
              brother, who despite everything, engaged me in tech and science.
              His love for games and technology deeply influenced me and
              inspired my career choice. Now as a Software Engineer, I thrive on
              perpetual learning and the exploration of emerging technologies.{" "}

              I assisted Palette in transitioning a TypeScript micro-service to
              Rust. My primary responsibilities included utilising Rustâ€™s
              asynchronous and multithreaded capabilities to optimise the
              performance and reliability of the micro-service. As result of the
              transition the new product is 2 times faster and capable to ingest
              up to 500k msg/s from Kafka.

              responsibilities, I oversee the maintenance of our CI/CD pipeline

                contribution I made was driving the adoption of Typescript
                across the company's front-end teams. This involved gradually
                refactoring existing codebases and teaching best practices.
