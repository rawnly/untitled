            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              At the age of 7, my passion for technology was sparked by my
              brother, who despite everything, engaged me in tech and science.
              His love for games and technology deeply influenced me and
              inspired my career choice. Now as a Software Engineer, I thrive on
              perpetual learning and the exploration of emerging technologies.

            >
              I assisted Palette in transitioning a TypeScript micro-service to
              Rust. My primary responsibilities included utilising Rustâ€™s
              asynchronous and multithreaded capabilities to optimise the
              performance and reliability of the micro-service. As result of the
              transition the new product is 2 times faster and capable to ingest
              up to 500k msg/s from Kafka.

              Led the front-end team in our endeavor to develop an accessible
              and maintainable platform that drives innovation in the
              blue-economy sector. In our tech stack, we leverage a monorepo
              architecture powered by Next.js, Turbo, and Typescript. To ensure
              the quality of our codebase, we employ Vitest for unit testing and
              conduct end-to-end testing using Playwright. As part of my
              responsibilities, I oversee the maintenance of our CI/CD pipeline
              with Github Actions. Additionally, I actively contribute to the
              development and upkeep of internal utilities and microservices
              written in Rust and Go.

              authentication system to support multi-tab functionality. As part
              of my role, I successfully created a new internal library that was

                and maintenance of various sections of the Smart TV app and
                website, using React as the primary framework. A significant
                contribution I made was driving the adoption of Typescript
                across the company's front-end teams. This involved gradually
                refactoring existing codebases and teaching best practices.
